### 2.2 HTMLDocument Properties and Methods (Including Inherited)

Many properties are available, even if the inherited properties were not considered. Iâ€™ve handpicked a list of noteworthy properties and methods for the context of this chapter:

* doctype
* documentElement
* implementation.*
* activeElement
* body
* head
* title
* lastModified
* referrer
* URL
* defaultview
* compatMode
* ownerDocument
* hasFocus()

> Notes
>
> The HTMLDocument node object (i.e., window.document) is used to access a great deal of the methods and properties available for working with the DOM (i.e., document.querySelectorAll()). Many of the properties that we do not cover in this chapter are discussed elsewhere in the book.
