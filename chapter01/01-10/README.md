### 1.10 Using appendChild() and insertBefore() to Add Node Objects to the DOM

* The appendChild() method will append a node (or multiple nodes) to the end of the child node(s) of the node the method is called on.
* The insertBefore() method requires two parameters: the node to be inserted and the reference node in the document before which you would like the node inserted.

> Notes
>
> If you do not pass a second parameter to the insertBefore() method, then it functions just like appendChild().
>
> * prepend()
> * append()
> * before()
> * after()
